				<h1>Translation</h1>

				<h2>What is translation?</h2>

				<p>The first issue of application of law to the world of code that Lessig addresses is translation. Lessig argues that there are two ways to interpret the constitution and other laws of the past in the modern day. The first of these Lessig calls <span>one-step originalism</span>, which focuses on enacting laws exactly as the founding fathers would have done.<a class="cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a> The second focuses on updating the constitution’s laws to preserve the rights that would originally have been protected by the constitution in the context of new technologies. Lessig calls this <span>translation</span>.</p>

				<p>To illustrate translation, Lessig considers <em>Olmstead v. United States</em> wiretapping case of 1928. The advent of the telephone presented a new way for privacy to be invaded without trespass. Under one-step originalism, the majority of justices argued that the constitution protects privacy exclusively in the case of physical trespass. However, Justice Brandeis opposed this strategy, opting to read the constitution backgrounded on contextual presuppositions at the time of framing. The original regime presupposed a common trespass law system, and focused on trespass because at the time, that was the primary way people would be searched by the government. In this way, Brandeis argued that the <span>old protections should be translated</span> so that the level of privacy previously enjoyed could be preserved. Almost 40 years later in 1967, the originalist <em>Olmstead</em> decision was overturned in <em>Katz v. United States</em>, favoring instead Brandeis’s translational strategy. The <em>Katz</em> case extended fourth amendment rights to protect all areas where an individual has a “reasonable expectation of privacy".<a class="cit" href="#ref-2">[2]</a> The U.S. government has been just as slow to address how constitutional rights should translate into cyberspace. </p>

				<h2>Translation in cyberspace</h2>

				<p>While the above addressed example specifically deals with translation of privacy rights, translation also applies to all other law applications in cyberspace, including those that Lessig specifically addresses: <a  href="/ip.html">intellectual property</a>, <a href="privacy.html">privacy, <a  href="freespeech.html">free speech</a>, and <a  href="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</a>.</p>

				<p>Too often, Lessig argues, issues related to translation are dealt with not at the level of legislators, but are rather hashed out in the courts. Ultimately, Lessig argues that the constitutional discourse of our present Congress is below the level it must be at to address the questions about constitutional values that are raised by cyberspace.<a class="cit" href="#ref-3">[3]</a> Congress fails to take on a translational role, and thus we have developed no uniform way to deal with constitutional issues as they arise in cyberspace. The following section explores some examples of attempted translation within the legislative branch to assess Lessig’s claim.</p>

				<h2>Recent case studies</h2>

					<p>Since <em>Code</em> was published, Congress has created legislation related to cyberspace but has generally chosen to do so in a way that does not directly dictate the architecture of the web. For example, the Child’s Internet Protection Act of 2000 demanded that schools implement measures to prevent children from accessing harmful web content.<a class="cit" href="#ref-4">[4]</a> Instead of building legal architecture to allow the web’s direct censorship, it mandates censorship at the level of public school administrations.</p>

					<p>In contrast, Congress has considered but never passed legislation that directly controls what sorts of content are allowed on the web. For example, SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA, which are laws that have aimed to address the problem of internet piracy, were not passed because they would have allowed direct regulation of the net (and according to many of the legislation’s detractors, unconstitutional levels of censorship).<a  class="cit" href="#ref-5">[5]</a></p>

					<p>Additionally, Congress has taken a relatively hands-off approach with regard to intellectual property and security issues. For example, Congress delegated the implementation and regulation of the domain name system (DNS) to a private sector organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).<a class="cit" href="#ref-6">[6]</a> A congressional research paper states that “the United States government has no statutory authority over ICANN and the domain name system." It is thus up to ICANN to resolve any lingering issues with regard to intellectual property and security that may arise as a result of the protocol they oversee.</p>

					<p>Congress also struck down the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, which would have provided strong security protections built into the infrastructure of the web.<a class="cit" href="#ref-7">[7]</a> Obama supported the measure, claiming that it was a necessary move to protect important information that is circulated online. However, it was struck down due to opposition from the private sector, which claimed that the mandated infrastructure change would place too heavy a burden on businesses. Instead, Congress decided to allow businesses to self-regulate the infrastructure as they see fit.</p>

					<p>As Lessig notes in <em>Code</em>, Congress has continually demonstrated a pattern of allowing infrastructure decisions that directly concern legal rights to private organizations. The constitutionality of their decisions can ultimately be decided by the courts, but Congress has been extremely wary of taking preemptive measures to ensure rights to privacy, intellectual property, and free speech. If Lessig is right, these rights cannot be guaranteed without legislative action.</p>

				<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

				<p>From a deontological standpoint, translation is more ethically sound than one-step originalism, as it would involve creating new rules so that the rights previously guaranteed are maintained--in other words, translation could be said to adhere to the ethical principles laid out by the framers.</p>
				<p>From a utilitarian perspective, it could be argued that creating new legislation would restrict the ability of private companies to produce optimal services. Private organizations aggressively opposed the 2012 Cybersecurity Act because of the burden it would place on them to enact it. A utilitarian might thus argue that allowing cyberspace issues to be addressed by private organizations might actually be the better option.</p>
