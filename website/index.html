				<h1>Coding Gravity</h1>
				<h2>The Tug-of-War between Builders and Breakers </h2>
			


				<p> Page Ive, Bharad Raghavan, Amber Rockwood, Cesar Torres </p>
				
				<p>
				Lessig argues that in order to regulate the Net, we must change its architecture and design. While libertarians such as <a target="_blank" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow'>John Perry Barlow </a> argue that a regulated Net will lose its original anything-goes, laissez-faire flavor, Lessig advocates that these two ideals can co-exist through the careful crafting of code and legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
				In <em><a href=''> Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace </a></em> Lessig discusses regulation on cyber issues that arose during the turn of the century. We will provide an overview of Lessig’s architecture and design principles, as well as a critique of their application to contemporary issues surrounding the Net.
				</p>
				<p>
				We will explore how issues from the new millenium have evolved as a result of a regulable architecture, or lack thereof, and analyze the strengths and limitations of Lessig’s code-is-god framework.
				</p>
				<p>
				We will then select emerging issues in the electronic frontier as case studies to which we will apply Lessig’s design principles and examine the tug-of-war between regulation and libertarian ideals.

					<h2>Lessig’s Take on Cyberspace</h2>
						<p>Lawrence Lessig is a political activist. He established the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford and continues his activism and scholarship at Harvard Law School. Lessig is a libertarian. As be states in his book, the libertarian standpoint is generally against government, but to be libertarian is to be against threats to liberty--regardless of where these threats come from (Lessig 85)<a class = “cit” href=”#ref-1”>[1]</a>. In “Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace,” Lessig examines threats to liberty with respect to the internet, examining the current state of the internet and where it is going. He examines “cyberspace as it is, and cyberspace as [he believes] it is becoming as it moves from a world of relative freedom to a world of relatively perfect control” (Lessig 23) <a class = “cit” href=”#ref-1”>[1]</a>. Lessig’s first central argument is that the extent to which behavior can be <span>regulated, or controlled, depends on software code </span>. In other words, the ability of the government to regulate people’s behavior online depends on the architecture of cyberspace. His second central argument is that the internet is becoming increasingly controlled and regulable--and not just by the government. Laying the foundation for a discussion about cyberspace, government regulation, and human values, he demonstrates that decisions pertaining to the design of cyberspace require significant deliberation.</p>
					 
					<h2>The Design of The Internet: TCP/IP Protocol</h2>

					<p>Lessig argues that whether a network is regulable depends on the design of its software, or the architecture of its code (Lessig 25)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. The design of a network allows for a broad spectrum of regulability. For example, regulation is far more difficult in networks defined by open and non-proprietary protocols than in tightly controlled proprietary networks (Lessig 27)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. </p>

					<p>The architecture of the internet is built upon a suite of protocols, two of the most important of which are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).The design of the TCP/IP suite on which the Internet is currently built reveals minimal information about the data exchanged and nothing about the identity of the user. As Lessig describes, "The web server simply knows that you are located on the Internet at an IP address, and that you are coming onto the Net with a TCP/IP-compliant protocol…The system knows that there are entities out there and interacting with it, but it knows nothing about who those entities are" (Lessig 33)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. This system alone does not allow for identification of users and poses a challenge to regulation. Cookies and other technologies make regulation easier.Technologies layered on top of TCP/IP protocols include Public Key Infrastructures, the Secure Socket Layer protocol, and the Secure Electronic Transaction protocol, among others </p>.
					  
					<h2>The Invisible Hand and e-Commerce: Gravitating Towards a Regulated Internet </h2>

					<p>It is quite possible to design a system for tight control and regulation; systems of certification such as public key infrastructures are "the kernel of an architecture of identity that would render cyberspace regulable" (Lessig 39)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Early online commerce augmented the drive toward more a regulable Internet, with the introduction of the secure socket layer (SSL) protocol and the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol (Lessig 39-40)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Lessig argues that the architectural changes necessary for the development of e-commerce augment the shift towards an increasingly controlled Net. He states, "…as the Net changes to enable commerce, one by-product of this change will be to enable regulation" (Lessig 43)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.</p>
					 
					<h2>The Government: Pushing Towards a Regulated Internet </h2>

					<p>According to Lessig, the invisible hand and government will together drive towards establishing a regulable Net. While he agrees that "given the architecture of the Net as it is, it is difficult for government to regulate behavior on the Net," he points out that the government can indirectly regulate behavior on the Net by directly regulating the Net’s architecture (Lessig 43)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Postulating a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms through which the government can regulate code, intermediaries, and individuals, he states: "The point is that within an integrated commercial and noncommercial network the government’s power over commercial entities leverages into a power over noncommercial entities" (Lessig 51)<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.</p>
