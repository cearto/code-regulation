				<h1>Intellectual Property</h1>

					<h2>What is Intellectual Property?</h2>

					<p>The World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) definition of Intellectual Property deems it to be creations of the mind, ranging from inventions, designs, names, and formulas, to artistic works and industrial processes. <a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a> Due to its abstract nature, Intellectual Property has proven to be the most difficult type of property to protect on the Internet, where ideas are disseminated and  replicated rapidly.  </p>

					<p>In the context of the book, we will focus exclusively on Intellectual Property that is protected by copyright. In the United States, copyright is a legal concept where the government grants the copyright holder the right to control the copying of their property.<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a> Ensuring that this rule is followed, however, has become much more difficult with the rise of the Internet. </p>

				<h2>Lessig’s Take on Intellectual Property</h2>

				<p>Surprisingly, Lessig is not overly worried about Intellectual Property theft. Instead, Lessig claims that the Internet will ensure that "copyright is more effectively protected than any time since Gutenberg"<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a>. Lessig observes that code will "displace law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace"<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a>, and the development of advanced programming protections mechanisms will ensure that "copyright is protected far too well"<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a>. These protections, coming to us in the form of "trusted systems", can more effectively serve us than the government itself. </p>

				<p>This, however, presents us with a conundrum. According to Lessig, the law will protect copyright holders "at least insofar as doing so gives them an incentive to produce". <a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a> In the government’s eyes, the main purpose of protecting Intellectual Property is to make sure owners have sufficient incentive to continue producing ideas, and also to make sure that the intellectual commons of society continues to grow for everyone’s benefit. </p>

				<p>With the rise of superior online architecture, Lessig fears that owners will soon be granted complete control over their Intellectual Property, making it much more difficult for the public to access their knowledge through the right of fair use. <a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a> Similarly, with the expansion of "trusted systems" and their ability to gather data from their users, Lessig is concerned that Internet users may be deprived of their anonymity. In response, Lessig argues that future architectures should prevent copyright holders from having complete control over their Intellectual Property,  so that an intellectual commons can be fostered and accessed without being at the mercy of the owners. Likewise, Lessig supports trusted systems that uphold anonymity on the web to protect the privacy of users while still gathering necessary information. </p>

				<h2> Intellectual Property in Cyberspace </h2>

				<p>Despite Lessig’s predictions, the state of Intellectual Property online over the past 10 years has been quite unexpected. As he predicted, copyright law has been supplanted by new layers of software architecture, allowing the owners of online content to have greater control over their Intellectual Property. Still, online piracy and file sharing networks have risen exponentially over the last decade, and their continued circumvention of online architectural barriers and copyright law have posed the largest threat to Intellectual Property to date. Additionally, in terms of fair use and accessibility of Intellectual Property, numerous sites have been formed with the sole purpose of fostering a strong intellectual commons. </p>

				<p>Despite improved methods for encrypting online data, Intellectual Property owners still are at the mercy of online piracy technology. A study in 2011 deemed 23.76% of all global internet traffic to be copyright-infringing, with BitTorrent, Cyberlocker sites (RapidShare, MegaUpload, etc.), and video streaming sites as the main mediums of piracy. It is estimated that over 20 million users use BitTorrent on a daily basis, with over 100 million unique users overall. Despite efforts by sites to provide consumers with online identities (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), online piracy clients focus on hiding the user’s identity, making it very difficult for companies to track down copyright violators. </p>

				<p>Lessig claimed that copyright law existed in order to provide content creators with an incentive to produce; since online piracy essentially bypasses copyright laws, one would think that the amount of content being uploaded online has drastically gone down as a consequence. One couldn’t be farther from the truth. The growth of data on the Internet has continued at a staggering pace with 48 hours of Youtube content being uploaded every minute, 684,478 pieces of content being shared on Facebook every minute, and 571 websites created every minute (as of December 2012). Despite the relative ineffectiveness of copyright laws online, there still seems to be a massive incentive to produce content. </p>

				<p>Finally, despite Lessig’s concern that online protections would greatly propetize online content and prevent the creation of an intellectual commons, numerous websites have sprung up with the intention of creating that intellectual hub online. Sites like Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and the Khan Academy are able to distribute information derived from thousands of copyrighted works through a Creative Commons license. Interestingly enough, Lawrence Lessig is the chairman of the organization that grants this license to other organizations!</p>

			<h2> Case Study: SOPA </h2>


			<p>Tackling intellectual property issues has proven to be a tricky endeavour at best. One could approach the problem from a legislative viewpoint, a technological perspective, or even a combination of both. In any case, the dynamic nature of the Internet makes it difficult to settle on any long term solution to the problem. </p>

			<p>In response to the dramatic growth of online piracy, Congress in 2011 introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). SOPA was created primarily to combat the massive intellectual property violations being committed on the Internet through online piracy. In essence, the law granted intellectual property owners the power to restrict access to foreign websites that violated their copyright by requesting search engines and payment websites to no longer collaborate with the accused website. The intellectual property owners could effectively pull the plug on websites by sending letters of complaint to Internet service providers; no formal court appearances were required. Additionally, any online attempt to circumvent this law had to be blocked or removed by hosting websites. In an attempt to prevent violations, SOPA would grant intellectual property owners excessive power over online content while forcing online websites to abide by the whims of the content creators. Needless to say, SOPA failed to pass through Congress because many felt, like Lessig, the amount of power granted to the Intellectual Property owners was a detriment to the online community overall. </p>

			<h2> A Review of Ethics </h2> 

			<p> From a deontological perspective, assuming that theft and piracy are immoral and that it’s the government’s duty to help prevent these crimes from occurring, Lessig’s stance on protecting intellectual property does not do enough, since Lessig believes that code will eventually replace the law when enforcing intellectual property rights. Instead, it could be argued that deontologically, the government should have a more active hand in passing bills that restrict piracy and intellectual property theft, even if it is inconvenient for users. From a utilitarian perspective, in trying to maximize happiness, Lessig’s stance would be better welcomed since he disfavors bills like SOPA, which help intellectual property owners at the expense of the rest of the online community.</p>
