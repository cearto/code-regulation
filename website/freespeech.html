<h1> Free Speech </h1>

<h2>What is Free Speech ?</h2>

<p>In Code and the Other Laws of Cyberspace Lessig defines the concept of free speech as “the right to be free from punishment by the government in retaliation for some (probably most) speech” (Lessig 165). It must be noted that the law is hardly the only entity that restrains and protects free speech. In society, free speech is both protected and constrained by societal norms, the market, and architecture (both physical and cyber) along with the law. Until very recently in our history, free speech was communicated across real-space and with non-electronic media. With the arrival of cyberspace, the boundaries of free speech have dramatically expanded. This portion focuses on how to protect free speech and regulate free speech in cyberspace. </p>

<h2>Lessig on Free Speech and Cyberspace</h2>

<p>Lessig claims that protection of free speech in cyberspace differs from protection in real-space due to a variety of factors. Since cyberspace can span multiple countries, a person’s free speech can be accepted in one country yet prosecutable in another. Additionally, the anonymous nature of cyberspace has influenced users to be more outspoken and less mindful of societal norms. However, the architecture of the Internet protects free speech more effectively than any other force. Due to “relative anonymity, decentralized distribution, multiple points of access, no necessary tie to geography, no simple system to identify content, [and] tools of encryption”, the Internet has empowered free speech so much that it’s now become a struggle to properly regulate (Lessig 166). </p>

In essence, the architecture of the Internet has more than empowered the concept of free speech on the Internet. What Lessig now focuses on is ways to regulate free speech before it causes any societal harm. Already architecture is being modified to better control free speech on the Internet, but Lessig discusses two types of architectural modifications in particular -- zoning architecture and filtering architecture. 

Zoning architecture prevents certain users from accessing certain websites that contain free speech that may still be inappropriate for them. For example, one could code enable browsers to have kid-IDs, notifying web pages that the current user is a minor. Sites with adult content will then be able to track users with kid-IDs and block them from seeing any inappropriate content, thus regulating their free speech (Lessig 176). 

Unlike zoning architecture which regulates free speech by blocking certain users, filtering architecture empowers the users to block out whatever free speech they choose. A prominent example is the World Wide Web Consortium’s platform for Internet content selection (PICS), which first labels all the content on the Internet and then filtering that content according to those labels. With this code in place, users can simply choose which content they wish to have filtered, and see only what they have allowed themselves to see (Lessig 177). 

Though it would seem that filtering architecture, which gives people more a choice, better preserves free speech, Lessig argues instead that zoning architecture better preserves the right of free speech. The key difference between the two schemes is the fact that with a zoning solution, the user is aware each time he or she is forbidden to enter a website. If the user feels being blocked from a specific site is unfair, they can contest that with the proper authorities to prevent any abuse of the architecture. On the other hand, the problem with filtering can be summed up with: “If you cannot see the content, you cannot know what is being blocked” (Lessig 179). Thus the user becomes unaware of the content that’s being shielded from them and sometimes unaware even of the extent the filter shields them from online content. In order to properly regulate free speech, the people must know when free speech is being regulated. The behind-the-scenes regulation by filters fosters an architecture that is ripe for abuse. 

In essence, cyberspace has drastically empowered the concept of free speech requiring it to be better regulated. Regulating free speech on the web is closely tied with cyber-architecture, thus one must be cautious when implementing regulations, as different approaches to the same goal may lead to drastically different results. 

<h2> Recent Case Studies </h2> 

<p>In 2000, Congress passed CIPA (Children’s Internet Protection Act), a law that provides discounts for internet service for public schools and libraries on the condition that the school or library in question install an online filter preventing users from accessing any site containing obscenity, child pornography, and content harmful to minors [3]. In essence, it’s an attempt to apply a filtering solution in order to regulate free speech on the internet in public schools and libraries. Though CIPA still exists today, it has faced heavy criticism from civil liberty organizations due to the fallibility of the online filters. Organizations warned parents that the online filters block websites primarily by searching for key phrases or words without evaluating their context [2]. This unrefined method of filtering has caused the filters to not only block harmless content like human rights websites or health websites but also sometimes let illegal content slip by [2]. Clearly, regulating free speech in cyberspace has proven to be a much more difficult task than previously anticipated.</p>


<p>Despite the government’s efforts to regulate free speech, the entities with the most influence on the topic happen to be technology companies like Facebook and Twitter. Dave Willner heads Facebook’s content policy team and helps remove inappropriate content ranging from nudity, hate speech, porn, and violence [4]. The team receives over 2 million requests to remove content daily, and has to wrangle with free speech laws spanning over 3 continents [4]. Still, apart from having to comply with free speech laws, the majority of regulation guidelines are determined by the company itself. For example, when the infamous video  Innocence of the Muslims  was first posted on Facebook, the content policy team reviewed the video and kept it online despite the riots that followed as a response to the video. The team reviewed the video and kept it, concluding that nobody said anything explicitly denigrating about Muslims [4]. This incident is but one example revealing the enormous influence social networks and other popular websites have on the protection and regulation of free speech. </p>


<h2> A Review of Ethics </h2>

<p> From a deontological perspective, the duty of the government and technological architecture should be to protect free speech and regulate it enough to protect other members of society while infringing on their personal freedoms as little as possible. To this end, Lessig’s preference for zoning solutions as opposed to filter solutions would align well with a deontologist. Since a zoning solution explicitly blocks inappropriate websites, it protects certain citizens from seeing obscene content, but since it notifies the user whenever it blocks a website, the user knows enough about the program to provide feedback if he or she feels the program is too excessive or permissive, thus ensuring  that their personal freedom isn’t unnecessarily restrained. From a utilitarian perspective, the right to free speech is essential for maximizing happiness. At the same time, however, a utilitarian would also agree with Lessig that free speech must restrained at times so as not to let harmful speech spread quickly throughout society. However, a utilitarian would most likely prefer a filtering solution as opposed to a zoning solution, since it’s possible for a user to select their own online filter (set to their preferences) instead of having to give up their right to visit certain websites that are blocked for everyone. </p>
