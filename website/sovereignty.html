				<h1> Sovereignty </h1>
				<h2>Who is the ruler of cyberspace?</h2>

				<p>While the number of connections between computers and devices have increased exponentially, these devices are beginning to share less connections with the physical world. As such, the laws that govern the trade of goods and services are less defined. In short, anything can be spoofed. Here lies the fundamental contention when attempting to regulate these technologies and the people that use them. The current architecture of the Internet allows a person to hide behind an IP address, and even then, that IP address can be altered to appear like another individual from another nation or state. Without a physical body to latch on to, laws and regulation are much harder to stick. 
				</p>

				<p>
				As such, the ease in which digital services and devices cross borders and transfer information around the world is perhaps one of the most attractive characteristics of the Web. At the same time, transborder data flow (TDF) is one of the most problematic activity on the Net, especially when laws and regulations of the state in which the data originated differs from the state of its final destination. While there exists a body of literature on international policy-making, there is an assumption that there exists a supreme law of the land. In cyberspace, this “king” has yet to emerge.
				</p>
				<p>
				A state is an entity that is the supreme law of the land, but the term land in cyberspace is loosely defined. A popular example is the emergence of Chinese movie streaming sites that served popular US movies at no charge without the rights to distribute from US companies. 
				While the US may attempt to censor that site from US citizens by preventing American IP addresses from accessing those Chinese sites, an individual could easily mask their IP address to appear from per se Canada which does not have the same level of concern for US copyright laws. Lawmakers are attempting to seal these loopholes with the recent introduction of the <a href=''>PROTECT IP Act</a>, a piece of legislation dedicated to ending online piracy by giving copyright holders and authorities the ability to seize domain names, block Internet Service Providers (ISPs), censor search engines, and cut funding of allegedly copyright infringing websites <a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a>. Already, the attempt to regulate cyberspace generates words such as <em>block</em>, <em>censor</em>, <em> cut</em>, <em>seize</em> which for little less have caused revolt. Already, hackers have started providing apps and instructables that allow easier access to proxy servers that can easily circumvent the reaches of such legislation simply by being located in a place of the world outside the control of the US Government. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<span>Ultimately, several incidents such as this have caused us to re-evaluate what cyberspace is, who lives in it, and ultimately who hold the supreme law of the land. </span>

				<h2>Determining the King of the Web</h2>

				<p>Three sovereignty conceptions are used to assess whether a state has sovereignty on Internet regulation. Legal definitions break this down into the realist, representational, and postmodern conceptions.<p>

				<ul>
					<li>Realist Conception [Deontological]
						<ul>
							<li>
								<ul>
									<li>
									States are sovereign to the extent that they are the supreme authority within a given territory. As such, they possess sole jurisdiction over its citizens and internal affairs. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<ul>
											<li> ISSUE: China’s regulation of western websites </li>
											<li>POLICY: The “brought-into” policy. Minnesota asserts the right to regulate a foreign web page that was accessed and "brought into" the state by a local resident.</li>
											<li>LOOPHOLE:  A person can use a proxy to go undetected by Minnesota ISPs. </li>
											<li>This method fails to provide a normative basis for regulation. Does Minnesota have this sole right, when in physical state commerce it is restricted by the federal government? State and local governments argue that federal legislation infringes on state sovereignty. </li>
											</uL>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>

				<h2>Recent case studies</h2>

					<p>Since <em>Code</em> was published, Congress has created legislation related to cyberspace, but has generally chosen to do so in a way that does not directly dictate the architecture of the web. For example, the Child’s Internet Protection Act of 2000 demanded that schools implement measures to prevent children from accessing harmful web content.<a class="cit" href="#ref-4">[4]</a> Instead of building legal architecture to allow the web’s direct censorship, it mandates censorship at the level of public school administrations.</p>

					<p>In contrast, Congress has considered but never passed legislation that directly controls what sorts of content are allowed on the web. For example, SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA, which are laws that have aimed to address the problem of internet piracy, were not passed because they would have allowed direct regulation of the net (and according to many of the legislation’s detractors, unconstitutional levels of censorship).<a  class="cit" href="#ref-5">[5]</a></p>

					<p>Additionally, Congress has taken a relatively hands-off approach with regard to intellectual property and security issues. For example, Congress delegated the implementation and regulation of the domain name system (DNS) to a private sector organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).<a class="cit" href="#ref-6">[6]</a> A congressional research paper states that “the United States government has no statutory authority over ICANN and the domain name system." It is thus up to ICANN to resolve any lingering issues with regard to intellectual property and security that may arise as a result of the protocol they oversee.</p>

					<p>Congress also struck down the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, which would have provided strong security protections built into the infrastructure of the web.<a class="cit" href="#ref-7">[7]</a> Obama supported the measure, claiming that it was a necessary move to protect important information that is circulated online. However, it was struck down due to opposition from the private sector, which claimed that the mandated infrastructure change would place too heavy a burden on businesses. Instead, Congress decided to allow businesses to self-regulate the infrastructure as they see fit.</p>

					<p>As Lessig noted in <em>Code</em>, Congress has continually demonstrated a pattern of allowing infrastructure decisions that directly concern legal rights to private organizations. The constitutionality of their decisions can ultimately be decided by the courts, but Congress has been extremely wary of taking preemptive measures to ensure rights to privacy, intellectual property, and free speech. If Lessig is right, these rights cannot be guaranteed without legislative action.</p>
