				<h1> Sovereignty </h1>
				<h2>Who is the ruler of cyberspace?</h2>

				<p>While the number of connections between computers and devices have increased exponentially, these devices are beginning to share less connections with the physical world. As such, the laws that govern the trade of goods and services are less defined. In short, anything can be spoofed. Here lies the fundamental contention when attempting to regulate these technologies and the people that use them. The current architecture of the Internet allows a person to hide behind an IP address, and even then, that IP address can be altered to appear like another individual from another nation or state. Without a physical body to latch on to, laws and regulation are much harder to stick. 
				</p>

				<p>
				As such, the ease in which digital services and devices cross borders and transfer information around the world is perhaps one of the most attractive characteristics of the Web. At the same time, transborder data flow (TDF) is one of the most problematic activity on the Net, especially when laws and regulations of the state in which the data originated differs from the state of its final destination. While there exists a body of literature on international policy-making, there is an assumption that there exists a supreme law of the land. In cyberspace, this “king” has yet to emerge.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<span>Ultimately, several incidents such as this have caused us to re-evaluate what cyberspace is, who lives in it, and ultimately who hold the supreme law of the land. </span>

				<h2>Determining the King of the Web</h2>

				<p> Sovereignty asks the fundamental question: who’s law is supreme? There are currently three ways of interpreting which laws apply in cyberspace.<a class = "cit" href="#ref-2">[2] </a> </p>
			<p> The<span> realist interpretation </span>restructures our current laws to have authority in cyberspaces. States are sovereign to the extent that they are the supreme authority within a given territory. As such, they possess sole jurisdiction over its citizens and internal affairs. <a class = "cit" href="#ref-2">[2] </a> </p>

                
             <p>
             	For instance, the state of Minnesota asserts that if it a service is in its border, it is under its control. Moreso, it interprets foreign websites as being “brought into” in the state, which have allowed it to regulate gambling sites. However, it is erroneous to use geographic location as a precedent for regulation. A person can just use a proxy to make their identifier report that they are accessing the content outside a regulable state as well as physically locatable people (an email could be a group of people). 
             </p>

                
			<p>
			A similar conception is the <span>representational interpretation</span>. In this instance, a government exists to protect the “general will of the populace”, which means they also protect a state’s ability to represent its citizens.
			</p>

			<p>
           	Sovereign Indian nations who might favor gambling are factored out of this equation. 
           </p>

           <p>
    <p>
    	The third, known as the <span>postmodern interpreation</span>, treats cyberspace as a whole different state with its own rules and favors self governance.<a class = "cit" href="#ref-3">[3] </a> However, the Internet is not created equal. It is unequal based on cultural or geographic privilege. Countries such as Nigeria that have a history of phising scams is disadvantaged in an self-regulated international market place.

				<h2>Recent case studies</h2>

				<p>
				A state is an entity that is the supreme law of the land, but the term land in cyberspace is loosely defined. A popular example is the emergence of Chinese movie streaming sites that served popular US movies at no charge without the rights to distribute from US companies. 
				While the US may attempt to censor that site from US citizens by preventing American IP addresses from accessing those Chinese sites, an individual could easily mask their IP address to appear from per se Canada which does not have the same level of concern for US copyright laws. Lawmakers are attempting to seal these loopholes with the recent introduction of the <a href=''>PROTECT IP Act</a>, a piece of legislation dedicated to ending online piracy by giving copyright holders and authorities the ability to seize domain names, block Internet Service Providers (ISPs), censor search engines, and cut funding of allegedly copyright infringing websites.<a class = "cit" href="#ref-1">[1] </a> However, it is becoming commonplace for users to access blocked content through proxy servers. 

				Other viewpoints see a different architecture for content on the web that circumvents sovereignty questions. One such view advocates for free content, and the business model adjust so that Content provides, programmers, artists, writers,  focus instead on developing relation or ancilliary products that cover costs.<a class = "cit" href="#ref-5">[5] </a> Since the rapid dispersal of code is paramount to internet business survival, a model with the loosest copyright law allows the code to be international and be dispersed quicker, benefiting the developer and the user.

				<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

				<p> A realist interpretation is favored in a deontological perspective. The same rules that govern and protect our freedoms are ported over into them new context of cyberspace.  Cyberspace is seen as an extended medium, but definitions of property, rights, and culpability are maintained. The evaluation of morality of a situation remains unchanged.  </p>
				<p> The representational viewpoint favors a utilitarian viewpoint by factoring the will of the many to regulate websites such as gambling and porn websites and justifies the use of strong censorship policies. The minority, in this case Indian nations that might favor gambling, are disadvantaged.
				<p> The postmodern conception is a libertarian approach that can be interpreted as deontologically as moving the question or morality from a central regulating entity to the general will of the online populace. This is perhaps the best model of the state of the Web today, where standards are created by the private sector that are in the best interest of the general populace.
